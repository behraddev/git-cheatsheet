1- git is used to control and track the project files

2- A good repository is a repository which is well documented and contains LICENSE and README.md at least.

3- A good document is clear and comprehensive.

4- "git clone" clones a repository into a new directory.
e.g. git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux

5- "git pull" will update local repository.
e.g. git pull

6-1 "git checkout": switches branches.
6-2 "git revert": will revert a commit and creates a new commit(revert commit). 
6-3 "git reset": will changes the HEAD. (so we can cancel our commits and clean up our history.)

7- "git rebase" and "git merge" use different ways to combine changes.

(m)---c1------
(b1)   \---c2

"rebase" will move our branch to end of destination branch.

(m)---c1------c2

"merge" will merge (:D) commits of "feature" branch and destination branch.

(no fast-forward)
(m)---c1------c3
(b1)   \---c2/

(fast forward)
(m)---c1------(no new commit)
(b1)   \---c2/

8- use "git log" to see history of commits.

9- use "git diff" to see changes of files.

10- "git tag x" is used for tagging (e.g. v1.1, v2, v3.6)
"git tag v1.4"

11- to contribute we must fork the repository and send pull request/ merge request after changing the source.

12- We can split our upcoming features to branchs and work on them separately.
